# Week 4 Seb

## Question 1

**What is the count of records in the model fact_trips after running all models with the test run variable disabled and filtering for 2019 and 2020 data only (pickup datetime)?** 

You'll need to have completed the ["Build the first dbt models"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVI30Vxzd6c) video and have been able to run the models via the CLI. 
You should find the views and models for querying in your DWH.

## Question 2

**What is the distribution between service type filtering by years 2019 and 2020 data as done in the videos?**

You will need to complete "Visualising the data" videos, either using [google data studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39nLTs74A3E) or [metabase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnLkrA7a6gM).

## Question 3

**What is the count of records in the model stg_fhv_tripdata after running all models with the test run variable disabled (:false)?**  

Create a staging model for the fhv data for 2019 and do not add a deduplication step. Run it via the CLI without limits (is_test_run: false).
Filter records with pickup time in year 2019.

## Question 4

**What is the count of records in the model fact_fhv_trips after running all dependencies with the test run variable disabled (:false)?**  

Create a core model for the stg_fhv_tripdata joining with dim_zones.
Similar to what we've done in fact_trips, keep only records with known pickup and dropoff locations entries for pickup and dropoff locations. 
Run it via the CLI without limits (is_test_run: false) and filter records with pickup time in year 2019.

## Question 5

**What is the month with the biggest amount of rides after building a tile for the fact_fhv_trips table?**

Create a dashboard with some tiles that you find interesting to explore the data. One tile should show the amount of trips per month, as done in the videos for fact_trips, based on the fact_fhv_trips table.
